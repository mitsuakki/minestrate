# minestrate

Isolated Minecraft minigame servers, on demand. REST API over Docker, written in Go.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Requires Docker running on the host and Go 1.22+.

```bash
# 1. Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/mitsuakki/minestrate
cd minestrate
go build -o minestrate ./cmd/minestrate

# 2. Configure
cp minestrate.example.yaml minestrate.yaml
# edit minestrate.yaml

# 3. Run
./minestrate --config minestrate.yaml
```

## Why

Running a Minecraft minigame lobby means spinning up isolated game servers on player demand and tearing them down cleanly when the game ends.
Doing this by hand doesn't scale. Doing it with a full Kubernetes cluster is overkill.<br>

**minestrate** is a single Go binary that exposes a REST API over the Docker socket.

- One `POST` creates an isolated PocketMine-MP server with its own network, port, and lifecycle.
- One `DELETE` drains and removes it.

## API

### Create a server

`POST /servers`

**Request:**

```http
POST /servers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "game":    "skywars",
  "players": 8
}
```

### Get server state

`GET /servers/{id}`

```json
{
  "id": "srv_01j4k",
  "state": "running",
  "address": "10.0.0.1",
  "port": 25565,
  "players": 4,
  "created": "2024-11-01T14:22:00Z"
}
```

### Stop a server

`DELETE /servers/{id}`

Transitions the server to `draining`. Players are notified, then the container is stopped and all resources are released. Returns `202 Accepted`.

### List servers

`GET /servers`

Returns the projection of all active servers. Stopped servers are not included.

## Design Decisions

### Port allocation is a pure injection.

The allocator maintains a bitset over the configured port range and reserves ports atomically with a CAS operation. Two servers can never share a port by construction; it is an invariant enforced at the data structure level, not a runtime check.

### Server lifecycle is a finite state machine.

The five states and their transitions are the only mutations allowed on a server record. Every HTTP handler maps to exactly one transition. This makes the system straightforward to reason about: if you know the current state, you know every possible next state.

### Worker pool is sized by M/M/c queueing theory.

Given a measured mean container start time $1/\mu$ and an expected peak request rate $\lambda$, the number of workers $c$ satisfies:

```math
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{c\mu} < 0.8
```

Beyond 0.8 utilisation, queue wait times grow non-linearly. The default of 4 workers handles up to $3.2\mu$ requests per second before queueing becomes noticeable.

### Network isolation is structural.

Each container receives a dedicated `/28` subnet carved from the configured block. Subnets are disjoint by construction; game servers cannot reach each other's networks unless explicitly routed.

### Authentication is stateless.

JWT verification is $O(1)$ and requires no database round-trip. The lobby signs tokens with a shared secret; minestrate verifies the signature and checks expiry. No session store, no distributed state.

### Start timeout is derived from measured variance.

The `start_timeout` value should be set to $\mu_T + 10\sigma_T$ where $\mu_T$ is the mean container start time and $\sigma_T$ its standard deviation, measured on your hardware. This bound (from Chebyshev's inequality) keeps false timeouts below 1% under any start time distribution.
